# 13. Design APIs in Cloud and Deploy them On-Premise

## Business Use Case Narrative
This scenario involves a deployment where the API Publisher/Store is running on the Cloud to reduce the hasle of managing these nodes manually.
At the same time in order to have maximum control of the API runtime, the actual APIs are deployed in on-premise API Microgateways.
The cloud will only be used as a place to design APIs.
