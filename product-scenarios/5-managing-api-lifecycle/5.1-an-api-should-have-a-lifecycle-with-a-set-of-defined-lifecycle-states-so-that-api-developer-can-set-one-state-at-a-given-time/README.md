# 5.1 An API should have a lifecycle with a set of defined lifecycle states so that API developer can set one state at a given time

## Approaches

### [5.1.1 API lifecycle state can be changed from one state to another](5.1.1-api-lifecycle-state-can-be-changed-from-one-state-to-another)
### [5.1.2 Published and Prototyped APIs should be visible in store](5.1.2-published-and-prototyped-apis-should-be-visible-in-store)
### [5.1.3 Published and Prototyped APIs should be invocable at the gateway](5.1.3-published-and-prototyped-apis-should-be-invocable-at-the-gateway)
### [5.1.4 Lifecycle history should be correctly shown](5.1.4-lifecycle-history-should-be-correctly-shown)
